            DUMBY.  Good evening, Lady Stutfield.  I suppose this will be the last
            ball of the season?<br>

            LADY STUTFIELD.  I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It’s been a delightful season,
            hasn’t it?<br>

            DUMBY.  Quite delightful!  Good evening, Duchess.  I suppose this will be
            the last ball of the season?<br>

            DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It has been a very dull
            season, hasn’t it?<br>

            DUMBY.  Dreadfully dull!  Dreadfully dull!<br>

            MR. COWPER-COWPER.  Good evening, Mr. Dumby.  I suppose this will be the
            last ball of the season?<br>

            DUMBY.  Oh, I think not.  There’ll probably be two more.  [_Wanders back
            to_ LADY PLYMDALE.]<br>

            PARKER.  Mr. Rufford.  Lady Jedburgh and Miss Graham.  Mr. Hopper.<br>
